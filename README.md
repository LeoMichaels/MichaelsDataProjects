Summary: This project analyzes a business's cloud billing costs across multiple cloud services. The company tracks usage using several attributes such as "amount of data transmitted," "time used," and "cost incurred." To simplify these metrics, I combined them into a single feature called Time_Usage_Utilisation. While this feature doesnâ€™t have a specific meaning on its own, it serves as a reflection of overall service usage.

The main goal of this project is to identify which cloud services are costing more relative to their usage. For example, some services (X, Y, Z) have been notably cheaper because the company has not only used them a lot (high data transmission), but they are also more cost-effective. The visualization helps a manager quickly identify services that are underperforming (marked in red) based on poor utilization, aiding in decisions about which services to drop.

# Tunisian-Property-Prices [Project-2]

Summary: This project involves descriptive trend analysis of property prices in Tunisia, with a focus on differentiating between expensive and affordable properties. The analysis breaks down property prices by region and property type (e.g., Apartments, larger buildings). The next step involves categorizing properties as "High," "Medium," or "Low" based on how far their price deviates from the median price in that region.

The goal is to help decision-makers prioritize properties that offer better value. For example, a lower-priced apartment in Region "XYZ" could be more attractive than a similarly priced property in another region. However, I recognize that I may be missing some of the real estate-specific nuances needed to fully justify such decisions. I plan to refine this approach as I progress with the next steps of the project.
