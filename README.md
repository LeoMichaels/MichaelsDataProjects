# GPL_Cloud Billing [Project-1]

Summary: This project looks at how a business is spending money on cloud services. The company uses many different services, and tracks things like how much data is used, how long the services are used, and how much each service costs. To make this easier to understand, I created a column of values that is a function of the other features called Time_Usage_Utilisation. It will contain a number for each service combining all of those different usage factors into one, showing how much each service is being used.

The main goal of this project is to help managers quickly see which cloud services are too expensive for how much they’re being used. For example, some services (like X, Y, and Z) are much cheaper because the company uses them a lot but they are still low-cost. The dashboard shows this in red to help managers make quick decisions on whether to drop services that are too expensive or not being used enough.

# Tunisian-Property-Prices [Project-2]

<br />
Summary: This project looks at property prices in Tunisia to help a stakeholder make smarter real estate decisions. There are different categories, like apartments and larger buildings, and I then compared prices across regions and by different building category. The next step is to label properties as "High," "Medium," or "Low" in terms of price. If a property is much more expensive or much cheaper than others, it gets labeled accordingly.
<br />
The goal here is to understand how certain types of properties are priced differently in different regions. For example, apartments may be a lot more cheaper in region XYZ compared to a different type of property. However, I’m still learning about the real estate market, so I plan to refine this approach and make it more accurate.
