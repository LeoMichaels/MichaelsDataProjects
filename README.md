<br />
Summary: This is a cloud billing costs of a business. They use multiple number of cloud-services and "usage" is being tracked by several attributes like "amount of information transimtted" or "time used" or "costs entailed", I have used a formula to put those features into a single column of numbers called Time_Usage_Utilisation which doesn't have meaning on its own but is rather a reflection of all other attributes related to how much the business has used that particular service.
<br />
<br />
Really, all this is meant to solve is that some services (for example X,Y,Z) have been a lot more cheaper than every other service provider because "we" the "company" have not only used those X,Y,Z a lot (lots of data transmitted through that service), but it was also quite cheap. So this is meant to help a layman manager make a quick decision to drop some services that are marked in "red" on the graphs - meaning that their utilisation is very poor related to every other service.
<br />
"Poor" and "High" utilisation in this context intends to mean that service X when factoring time, costs over time, and data transmitted over said service it has a lower score under the Time_Usage_Utilisation feature. The converse will be reflected by higher scores on that feature.

<br />
<br />
Summary: Used Descriptive Trend analytics and separating categories of expensive to not-expensive properties. The graphs shows different regions having pricier or less-pricier properties of which there are several categories - Apartments or larger building desigations. The next step being included in this is a distinction on what the "High, Medium, Low" designate. This was assigned to each property based on how far away they were from the median price of their property. So if they deviated far from what was normal, it was either High or Low. The objective here was to make decisions on say to prefer Apartment Properties in City or Region "XYZ" over something else merely because it had lower price prices. But I may be lacking the Real-Estate nuance required to justify such a decision - I will amend this example accordingly when finishing the next step.
