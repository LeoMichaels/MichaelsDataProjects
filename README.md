# GPL_Cloud Billing [Project-1]

Summary: This project looks at how a business is spending money on cloud services. The company uses many different services, and tracks things like how much data is used, how long the services are used, and how much each service costs. To make this easier to understand, I created a single number called Time_Usage_Utilisation. This number combines all of those different factors into one, showing how much each service is being used.

The main goal of this project is to help managers quickly see which cloud services are too expensive for how much theyâ€™re being used. For example, some services (like X, Y, and Z) are much cheaper because the company uses them a lot but they are still low-cost. The dashboard shows this in red to help managers make quick decisions on whether to drop services that are too expensive or not being used enough.

# Tunisian-Property-Prices [Project-2]

<br />
Summary: This project involves descriptive trend analysis of property prices in Tunisia, with a focus on differentiating between expensive and affordable properties. The analysis breaks down property prices by region and property type (e.g., Apartments, larger buildings). The next step involves categorizing properties as "High," "Medium," or "Low" based on how far their price deviates from the median price in that region.

The goal is to help decision-makers prioritize properties that offer better value. For example, a lower-priced apartment in Region "XYZ" could be more attractive than a similarly priced property in another region. However, I recognize that I may be missing some of the real estate-specific nuances needed to fully justify such decisions. I plan to refine this approach as I progress with the next steps of the project.
